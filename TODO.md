- fix double sign up
  - check what happens if a browser with already signed up user gets another signup
  - make it so that it doesn't break with a second sign up
  - "Overwrite User" - "Keep Existing" - should go back to /login
  - In the best case, with an already signed up user, it should just go to /login
