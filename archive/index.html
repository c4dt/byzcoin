    <h1>OmniLedger demo archive</h1>
    <p>This demo allows you to run a blockchain on your local computer and play around with it.
        It is based on OmniLedger, which is a blockchain service built upon the
        <a href="https://factory.c4dt.org/showcase/omniledger/presentation">ByzCoin</a> paper from the
        <a href="https://dedis.epfl.ch">DEDIS</a> lab at EPFL.
        It has been supported and extended by the <a href="https://c4dt.epfl.ch">C4DT</a> and is now available
        as a standalone, archived demo that can be run on your computer.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can find more information on our blog post here: <a href="https://c4dt.epfl.ch/article/omniledger-2/">OmniLedger</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you typed <code>docker compose up</code>, four nodes started communicating with each other
        and awaiting commands from a client.
        The first thing you should do is to create a new user connected to the blockchain.
        To do this, click on the following link: <span id="signup"></span>.
        Now you are ready to look at the different services offered by this demo.
    </p>

    <h2>Services</h2>

                <h5 class="card-subtitle">Login service and handling users</h5>
                <p class="card-text">This service allows administration of a user credential on the blockchain.
                    You can read more in the blog post about
                    <a href="https://c4dt.epfl.ch/article/dynacred/">Account Management in Omniledger</a>.
                    Internally we used it to connect to other services, like our matrix instance for internal
                    discussions: <a href="https://c4dt.epfl.ch/article/cas-for-omniledger/">CAS Login using
                        OmniLedger</a>.
                    Connecting mobile devices was a bit more complicated, but today's passwordless authentication
                    services
                    also involve scanning of QRCodes, like did our solution to
                    <a href="https://c4dt.epfl.ch/article/matrix-on-mobile/">Login to Matrix on Mobile</a>.
                    The final service we implemented was a
                    <a href="https://c4dt.epfl.ch/article/omniledger-email-signup-and-recovery/">Signup and Recovery</a>
                    tool for OmniLedger.
                    This allowed anybody from EPFL to get an OmniLedger credential and then use it to sign on to our
                    matrix chat.

                    You can follow forward- and backward-links to different blocks
                    and display their content.
                    It interprets most of the transactions correctly.

    <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
    <p>If you're stuck and things don't work anymore, it's best to start from scratch.
        You need the following to do so:
    <ol>
        <li>On the <a href="/login">login page</a>, you need to
            <a href="https://www.leadshook.com/help/how-to-clear-local-storage-in-google-chrome-browser/">delete all
                local storage</a></li>
        <li>Stop docker compose: <code>docker compose down</code></li>
        <li>Delete the data from the nodes: <code>rm -rf nodes</code></li>
        <li>Start the nodes again: <code>docker compose up</code></li>
        <li>Re-create the login with the link on this page</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
