    <h1>OmniLedger Login Service</h1>
    <p>
        Here you can find a walkthrough to explore what the OmniLedger login can do.
        Feel free to send questions to the <a href="mailto:c4dt-services@listes.epfl.ch">C4DT Factory</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Register User</h2>
    <p>
        As a first step, you need to register your user on the blockchain.
        The docker images for this demo contain already an initialized blockchain, so you can simply use the
        following link to <span id="signup"></span>
    </p><p>
        By signing up to the local OmniLedger blockchain, a secret key is stored in your browser.
        The new state of the blockchain is also stored in the <code>node/*</code> directories, with one directory for
        each node.
        Once you registered, you're ready to go to the next step.
    </p>
    <h2>Update User Attributes</h2>
    <p>
        Now that you're signed up, you can change your name and see the new block on the
        chain:
        go to <a href="/login/admin/yourself">Contact Information</a>, change your alias and then
        click on <code>Update Credential</code>.
        You'll see a small animation of a block being included in the blockchain, and your
        credential is updated.
    </p>
    <h2>Simple block explorer</h2>
    <p>
        The user interface also contains a very simple block explorer at the bottom.
        Click on the block <code>Latest blocks</code> and then on the block to the right.
        You can see the creation date of the block, and links to the previous blocks.
        In the lower part, click on <code>ByzCoin Body</code>, and you'll the instruction in the block
        representing your change of name.
        One of the standalone features of ByzCoin are the multilevel links, which you can see
        as blue rectangles in the <code>BackwardLinks</code> and <code>ForwardLinks</code> fields.
        This allows for very fast catchup mechanisms and very thin clients.
    </p>
    <h2>Creating a new User</h2>
    <p>
        Let's create a second credential and move tokens between the two.
        Switch to the <a href="/login/admin/contacts">Contacts Tab</a> and click on <code>Create Contact</code>.
        Give it an alias and choose <code>Admin</code> for the <code>Default view</code>, then click
        on <code>Create</code>.
        Once the animation with the block adding finishes, open the <code>New User Signup</code> link in a
        <code>Private Navigation Tab</code>.
        It is important not to open the link in the main browser, else it will overwrite your
        credential, and you will have no possibility to recover it - besides starting from scratch
        as described <a href="/index.html">in the main document</a>.
        Confirm by clicking on <code>Register User</code> and <code>Start Demonstrator</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now you have two credentials open: your original credential, and the one in the private
        navigation.
        In your main credential, click on the <code>Transfer</code> link next to the name of the new
        credential you just created.
        Enter a number between 1 and 100 to transfer some tokens to the new credential.
        When confirming with <code>Transfer</code>, once the animation is done, you see the
        <code>Memory</code> field of the new credential updating with the number of tokens you
        transferred.
        You can also look at this transaction in the blockchain explorer at the bottom of the page.
